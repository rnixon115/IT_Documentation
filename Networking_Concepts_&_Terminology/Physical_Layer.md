# Physical Layer
The physical layer consists of physical media to *connect* to other devices.
1. Ethernet Cables
2. Fiber
3. Wireless
4. Satellite
5. Cellular
   
### The phyiscal layer is about the *hardware instead of software*, so, problems can consist of:
1. Fixing cables / replacing cables
2. Crimping
3. Punching down
4. Running loopback test
5. Swapping Network Interface cards
6. etc

### Bit synchronization 
- Bit synchronization is important because both the sender and receiver need to stay in time with each other,
so that the receiver knows when the bit ends and begins.
### Data Rate
- Data rate is how much data can be sent at a time. ( 1 MB of data = 8 Mbps )
### Physical Topologies 
- Physical Topologies are how to define networking devices in a structure. ( Star, Mesh, Bus, Ring )
