# OSI Model 

## What is The OSI Model
  - ##### OSI Model stands for "Open Systems Interconnection Model."
- ##### OSI Is A Guide
  - The OSI is a model, so that means it's flexible to fit the context of the problem.
- ##### OSI Protocol Isn't In Use
  - We don't use the OSI protocol suite because the TCP/IP suite is common in the IT world.
- ##### Protocols and Layers
- There are unique protocols in each layer of the OSI model
- There are 7 layers, starting at the top:
    1. Application
    2. Presentation
    3. Session
    4. Transport
    5. Network
    6. Data Link
    7. Physical
##### An easy way to remember the OSI Model is by using it in a mnemonic. So,
    1. Aldi's
    2. Presents
    3. Sourdough
    4. To
    5. Nile's
    6. Dad's
    7. Parents
