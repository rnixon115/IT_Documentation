# CSMA/CD

## What Does CSMA/CD mean?
CSMA/CD stands for **Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection**. So, plug-in communicating devices essentially share the same cable on a switch or a hub. The device's NIC, or **Network Interface Card**, needs to know who should send data at what time. So, CSMA/CD determines which computer should use the shared cable at a time.
