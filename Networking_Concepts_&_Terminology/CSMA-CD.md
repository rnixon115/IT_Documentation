# CSMA/CD

## What Does CSMA/CD mean?
CSMA/CD stands for **Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection**. It is used in network environments where multiple devices share the same cable, such as with hubs or shared Ethernet segments. The device's NIC, or **Network Interface Card**, needs to know who should send data at what time. CSMA/CD determines which computer should use the shared cable at a time
